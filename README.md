## What this repo shows
- **Notebook**: end-to-end EDA → features → models (LR vs XGBoost) → insights.
- **Slides**: business-facing presentation and recommendations.
- **Trello**: proof of teamwork & process.
- **(Later)**: `/app` folder with Streamlit code & model.

**Data source:** Kaggle — DSI-SG Project 2 Regression Challenge (HDB Price):
